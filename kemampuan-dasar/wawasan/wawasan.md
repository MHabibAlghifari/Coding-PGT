<p>information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of data[1] and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies.[2] IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT). [3]An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.</p>

<h2>Computer</h2> <p>science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.</p>

<h2> Software development vs. Web development </h2>
	In computer programming both software development and web development refers to the same engineer or programmer and the process of coding. [8]

<p>Note: software programs, esp. mobile apps can operate on the web.

Software development is focused on the programs (or software) used in computer systems. Software developers are responsible for the concept, creation, programming, some documenting, testing, improving and maintaining the software and its software components. 

Software developers (and mobile software engineers) create programs and mobile applications for stand-alone desktop computers and mobile devices and their platforms. 

Software developers need to have understanding of not only development best practices, but also the theory behind the programming. 

Web developers use coding and writing markup to create interactive webpages.[8]

Web development can be divided into two separates, the client side and server side. Client-side programming is responsible for every element that users can directly access on the web page, and the client-side systems allow the users to tell the webpage what they want it to do, while the server-side systems are responsible for fulfilling those requests. </p>

<h2> The Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h2><p> Agile software development values
Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the authors of the manifesto declared that they valued:[5]

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is to say, while both sides have value and the items on the right should be considered, the authors felt that the items on the left should have more influence on how people approach their work.

As Scott Ambler explained:[23]

Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.
Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.
A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.
A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people's understanding of the problem and its solution.
Some of the authors formed the Agile Alliance, a non-profit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's values and principles. Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said,

The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as "hackers" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.</p>

<h2> Scrum (software development)</h2> <p>Scrum or SCRUM, is a framework for project management,[1] with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.[2] It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or fewer, called daily scrums (a form of stand-up meeting). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve. </p>

<h2> Extreme programming</h2> <p> Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously (i.e. the practice of pair programming).</p>
